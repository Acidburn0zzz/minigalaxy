# TODO list
This is a simple list of items which still need doing before MiniGalaxy can be officially released:

Currently it contains the following items:

* Create a Gtk.Application class which is called first (to let the operating system know the application name and icon)
* Create a ``setup.py`` which uses setuptools
* Package for Debian and Arch (Maybe flatpak or appImage as well, not sure yet)
* Make users able to remove games (maybe also view game files)
