# TODO list
This is a simple list of items which still need doing before MiniGalaxy can be officially released:

Currently it contains the following items:

* Package for Debian and Arch (Maybe flatpak or appImage as well, not sure yet)
* Make users able to remove games (maybe also view game files)
